# format_tree_names

This script is to format names for inferring gene trees if interest after orthofinder output. I made it because I ran the analysis with fasttree and wanted to re-run some gene trees with IQTree. I think Orthofinder has an option to run with IQtree, but this was much faster and I didn't want it it affect the results I had already analyzed.
